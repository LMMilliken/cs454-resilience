53	Creates Operators needed for model evaluation and returns.     It gets prediction over inputs via Cloud ML Engine BatchPrediction API by   calling MLEngineBatchPredictionOperator, then summarize and validate   the result via Cloud Dataflow using DataFlowPythonOperator.     For details and pricing about Batch prediction, please refer to the website   https://cloud.google.com/ml-engine/docs/how-tos/batch-predict   and for Cloud Dataflow, https://cloud.google.com/dataflow/docs/     It returns three chained operators for prediction, summary, and validation,   named as <prefix>-prediction, <prefix>-summary, and <prefix>-validation,   respectively.   (<prefix> should contain only alphanumeric characters or hyphen.)     The upstream and downstream can be set accordingly like:   pred, _, val = create_evaluate_ops(...)   pred.set_upstream(upstream_op)   ...   downstream_op.set_upstream(val)     Callers will provide two python callables, metric_fn and validate_fn, in   order to customize the evaluation behavior as they wish.   - metric_fn receives a dictionary per instance derived from json in the   batch prediction result. The keys might vary depending on the model.   It should return a tuple of metrics.   - validation_fn receives a dictionary of the averaged metrics that metric_fn   generated over all instances.   The key/value of the dictionary matches to what's given by   metric_fn_and_keys arg.   The dictionary contains an additional metric, 'count' to represent the   total number of instances received for evaluation.   The function would raise an exception to mark the task as failed, in a   case the validation result is not okay to proceed (i.e. to set the trained   version as default).     Typical examples are like this:     def get_metric_fn_and_keys():   import math # imports should be outside of the metric_fn below.   def error_and_squared_error(inst):   label = float(inst['input_label'])   classes = float(inst['classes']) # 0 or 1   err = abs(classes-label)   squared_err = math.pow(classes-label, 2)   return (err, squared_err) # returns a tuple.   return error_and_squared_error, ['err', 'mse'] # key order must match.     def validate_err_and_count(summary):   if summary['err'] > 0.2:   raise ValueError('Too high err>0.2; summary=%s' % summary)   if summary['mse'] > 0.05:   raise ValueError('Too high mse>0.05; summary=%s' % summary)   if summary['count'] < 1000:   raise ValueError('Too few instances<1000; summary=%s' % summary)   return summary     For the details on the other BatchPrediction-related arguments (project_id,   job_id, region, data_format, input_paths, prediction_path, model_uri),   please refer to MLEngineBatchPredictionOperator too.     :param task_prefix: a prefix for the tasks. Only alphanumeric characters and   hyphen are allowed (no underscores), since this will be used as dataflow   job name, which doesn't allow other characters.   :type task_prefix: str     :param data_format: either of 'TEXT', 'TF_RECORD', 'TF_RECORD_GZIP'   :type data_format: str     :param input_paths: a list of input paths to be sent to BatchPrediction.   :type input_paths: list[str]     :param prediction_path: GCS path to put the prediction results in.   :type prediction_path: str     :param metric_fn_and_keys: a tuple of metric_fn and metric_keys:   - metric_fn is a function that accepts a dictionary (for an instance),   and returns a tuple of metric(s) that it calculates.   - metric_keys is a list of strings to denote the key of each metric.   :type metric_fn_and_keys: tuple of a function and a list[str]     :param validate_fn: a function to validate whether the averaged metric(s) is   good enough to push the model.   :type validate_fn: function     :param batch_prediction_job_id: the id to use for the Cloud ML Batch   prediction job. Passed directly to the MLEngineBatchPredictionOperator as   the job_id argument.   :type batch_prediction_job_id: str     :param project_id: the Google Cloud Platform project id in which to execute   Cloud ML Batch Prediction and Dataflow jobs.
